## Projects

### Item Authoring and Previewing

One of the most important capabilities in our platform is providing interfaces
for authoring and previewing assessment questions of various types. In this
challenge, you will create your own Multiple-Choice style item authoring
interface, including a way to define the correct answer, and preview the student
experience as an author.
